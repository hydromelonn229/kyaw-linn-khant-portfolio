        <p>
          I'm Kyaw Linn Khant, a Robotics and AI engineering graduate who thrives at the intersection of control systems, intelligent machines, and real-world deployment. My journey is defined not just by what I've built, but by how I've grown, turning challenges into catalysts and discomfort into discipline. I bring a mindset shaped by competition, constant self-improvement, and a deep desire to push past limits both technically and personally.
        </p>

        <p>
          With hands-on experience in embedded systems, reinforcement learning, edge AI, and robotic simulation, I've developed projects ranging from autonomous microcontroller vehicles to AI-powered self-balancing robots trained in MuJoCo and deployed on Raspberry Pi. My work spans the full stack of robotics, from low-level firmware and hardware integration to high-level AI logic and behavior control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond engineering, I've held leadership roles, most notably as Vice President of the IES-PSBA Student Chapter, where I organized technical talks and team events while volunteering at national outreach activities. I value responsibility, initiative, and the power of community. At the same time, I respect solitude, where I do my deepest thinking and produce my best work.
        </p>

        <p>
          I approach robotics not just as a career but as a craft where intelligence meets precision and passion meets resilience. I'm not here just to keep up with the future; I'm here to help engineer it.
